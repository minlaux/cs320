The function [list_nchoose(xs)(n0)]
returns all the subsequences of xs that are
of length n0.
//
let
list_nchoose
(xs: 'a list)(n0: int): 'a list list =
//
Please give a NON-RECURSIVE implementation of
list_nchoose based on list-combinators. Note that
the order of the elements in a list representation
of a subsequenc is SIGNIFICANT. For instance, [1;2]
and [2;1] are DIFFERENT.
